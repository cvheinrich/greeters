I'm a history buff, so Innsbruck was a treasure trove for me. The Hofburg and Hofkirche gave me a deep dive into Tyrolean history, especially the life of Emperor Maximilian I. I also loved the Tirol Panorama Museum, which had fascinating exhibits on the region’s past. Even the streets themselves tell stories—you can see the legacy of different eras in the buildings and layout of the city.
