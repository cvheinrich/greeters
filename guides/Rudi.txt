Innsbruck charmed me with its vibrant culture and friendly locals. I arrived during the Christmas season, and the markets were like something out of a fairytaleâ€”twinkling lights, handmade crafts, and the smell of mulled wine everywhere. Even outside the holidays, the city is alive with music and festivals, and I loved how the locals are so proud of their traditions and happy to share them.
