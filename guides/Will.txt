I'm really into photography, and Innsbruck was a dream come true. The contrast between the brightly colored houses along the River Inn and the rugged mountains behind them made for perfect shots. The light is magical during golden hour, especially from the Hungerburg funicular. The old town also offered lots of quirky angles and ornate details that kept my camera clicking all day.
