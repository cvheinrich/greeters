I absolutely loved Innsbruck for its stunning alpine setting—waking up to the sight of snow-covered mountains is unforgettable. The mix of nature and urban life is perfect; I could go hiking in the Nordkette in the morning and explore medieval streets in the old town in the afternoon. The Golden Roof was a highlight, and I enjoyed sipping coffee at cafés with centuries of history. Plus, the architecture blending Gothic, Baroque, and modern styles really captured my attention.
