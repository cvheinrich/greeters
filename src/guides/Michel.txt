Innsbruck really appealed to me as someone who likes to travel with family. The Alpenzoo was a hit with my kids, and the cable cars made it easy for everyone to enjoy the mountain views. The city felt safe and manageable, with lots of parks and open areas. We especially enjoyed the Swarovski Crystal Worlds just outside of townâ€”it was both magical and entertaining for all ages.
