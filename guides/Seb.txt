As a foodie, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Tyrolean cuisine in Innsbruck. From hearty dishes like Tiroler Gr√∂stl to sweet treats like Kaiserschmarrn, every meal was delicious. I also appreciated how many local ingredients are used. The mountain huts served the best cheese platters, and I even took a food tour that introduced me to locally brewed schnapps and unique alpine herbs.
