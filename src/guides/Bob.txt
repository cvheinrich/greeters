As a student of architecture, Innsbruck fascinated me with its fusion of historic buildings and contemporary design. The Bergisel Ski Jump, designed by Zaha Hadid, is an architectural marvel and offers a fantastic view of the city. I also enjoyed visiting Ambras Castle and seeing the incredible collection of armor and art. Walking through Maria-Theresien-Strasse with its lively atmosphere and mountain views was also a daily pleasure.
