I found Innsbruck to be a deeply spiritual place, even beyond its churches and cathedrals. The serene atmosphere in the mountains made for perfect moments of reflection. I spent time at Wilten Abbey and found it incredibly peaceful. The natural beauty of the area, especially around the Patscherkofel and along the Inn River, felt like a retreat from the noise of everyday life.
