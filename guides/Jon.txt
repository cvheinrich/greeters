What fascinated me about Innsbruck was its mix of cultures. Nestled between Italy and Germany, you can sense both influences in the food, language, and even fashion. The blend creates a unique vibe that you donâ€™t find elsewhere. I met students from all over Europe at the University of Innsbruck, and the conversations we had about identity, tradition, and the future made my time there truly enriching.
