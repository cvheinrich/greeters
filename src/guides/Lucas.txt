What struck me most about Innsbruck was how outdoor activities are so seamlessly woven into everyday life. One moment you're shopping in a chic boutique, and 30 minutes later you're snowboarding down a world-class slope. I tried paragliding for the first time there, and the view over the Inn Valley was breathtaking. In summer, I hiked through the nearby Stubai Alps, and in winter, the ski resorts were just a short bus ride away.
