As a photographer, I was constantly inspired by the views in Innsbruck, especially the colorful houses along the River Inn framed by dramatic mountains. I also found a surprising sense of peace thereâ€”being in nature felt almost spiritual, especially when I wandered around Patscherkofel or stood quietly at Wilten Abbey. Even the food seemed to reflect the landscape, simple but rich, like the hearty mountain cheeses served in remote huts. It was a place that satisfied both the eye and the soul.
